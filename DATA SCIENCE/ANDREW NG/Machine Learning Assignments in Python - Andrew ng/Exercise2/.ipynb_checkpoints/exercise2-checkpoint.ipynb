    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will implement logistic regression and apply it to two different datasets. Before starting on the programming exercise, we strongly recommend watching the video lectures and completing the review questions for the associated topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the information you need for solving this assignment is in this notebook, and all the code you will be implementing will take place within this notebook. The assignment can be promptly submitted to the coursera grader directly from this notebook (code and instructions are included below).\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin with the exercises, we need to import all libraries required for this programming exercise. Throughout the course, we will be using [`numpy`](http://www.numpy.org/) for all arrays and matrix operations, and [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/) for plotting. In this assignment, we will also use [`scipy`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/), which contains scientific and numerical computation functions and tools. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can find instructions on how to install required libraries in the README file in the [github repository](https://github.com/dibgerge/ml-coursera-python-assignments)."

You wrote a cost function and calculated its gradient, then took a gradient descent step accordingly. This time, instead of taking gradient descent steps, you will use the [`scipy.optimize` module](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/optimize.html). SciPy is a numerical computing library for `python`. It provides an optimization module for root finding and minimization. As of `scipy 1.0`, the function `scipy.optimize.minimize` is the method to use for optimization problems(both constrained and unconstrained).\n",

This indicates that we are only providing a reference to this function, and not evaluating the result from this function.\n",

This is all done by `optimize.minimize`: you only needed to provide a function calculating the cost and the gradient.\n",

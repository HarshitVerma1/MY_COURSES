Myself Harshit Verma , I am student of "Rajkiya engineering college Sonbhadra"(http://recsonbhadra.ac.in) . This is government college because i am unable to pay fees of Private college.  I am a good student but my father is a poor farmer. So I unable to pay for this course   but I am excited for this course.

I will be a good Developer in Web Developer , if you accept my application then you make a future of a poor boy.  I am student of "Rajkiya engineering college Sonbhadra"(http://recsonbhadra.ac.in) . This is government college because i am unable to pay fees of Private college.  I am a good student but my father is a poor farmer. So I unable to pay for this course   but I am excited for this course. I am student  and I don't have any special source of income I was in governmental school which means that i had a free education in my country. Thereâ€™s a serious shortage of web developers out there, which is why we guarantee job placement within six months of graduating...so i am choosing web devlopment  course . We can use Machine Learning in Artificial intelligence and also i will learn many topics in Artificial intelligence from UDACITY and I will make the best authentication app in Android and also i want to make a Smart Dustbin for our country which is possible by Artificial intelligence .
